## Mission

At the VVAI Lab, we are passionate about advancing the frontiers of **visualization**, **AR/VR technology**, and **human-computer interaction**.

## How to pronounce?

The first two letters of the lab name, "VV", can be viewed as "W".
So VVAI can be pronounced as "WAI" (pronounced as "why") Lab.

## History
